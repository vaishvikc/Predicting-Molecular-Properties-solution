# Predicting-Molecular-Properties-challenge-solution
Dataset :- https://www.kaggle.com/c/champs-scalar-coupling\
This challenge aims to predict interactions between atoms. Imaging technologies like MRI enable us to see and understand the molecular composition of tissues. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is a closely related technology which uses the same principles to understand the structure and dynamics of proteins and molecules.<br>
